# Snakes on a Plane 🐍✈️

A collection of classic Snake games built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - created during a 20-minute flight on American Airlines.

## What's Inside

This project features a nostalgic 90s-style web portal that links to 6 different Snake game variations:

- **index.html** - The main portal with authentic 90s styling (yellow header, Times New Roman, simple layout)
- **snake1.html** through **snake6.html** - Individual Snake game implementations

## Features

- 🎮 Classic Snake gameplay with arrow key controls
- 🎨 Retro 90s web design aesthetic
- 📱 Simple, lightweight games that run in any browser
- ⚡ No external dependencies - pure vanilla JavaScript

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click on any of the "Snake" links to start playing
3. Use arrow keys to control your snake
4. Eat the red apples to grow longer
5. Don't hit the walls or yourself!

## Development

This was a quick coding exercise born out of boredom on a flight. Each snake game is self-contained in its own HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas and basic JavaScript ES5.

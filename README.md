# Snakes on a Plane 🐍✈️

A collection of "Snake" themed mini-games and interactive experiences built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - created during a 20-minute flight on American Airlines.

## What's Inside

This project features a nostalgic 90s-style web portal that links to 6 different "Snake" themed mini-games and experiences:

- **index.html** - The main portal with authentic 90s styling (yellow header, Times New Roman, simple layout)
- **snake1.html** - Classic Snake Game - Traditional snake gameplay with arrow key controls
- **snake2.html** - Gangster Chat - Interactive chat simulation referencing "Angels with Filthy Souls"
- **snake3.html** - Snake Jailbird - Interactive Simpsons character page with quotes and escape sequence
- **snake4.html** - Samuel L Jackson Generator - Text input that generates Pulp Fiction style phrases
- **snake5.html** - Solving The Snake Case - A snake_case programming style mystery story
- **snake6.html** - Snake Eyes - Dice rolling game that keeps rolling until you get snake eyes (1,1)

## Features

- 🎮 One classic Snake game with arrow key controls (snake1.html)
- 💬 Interactive chat experiences and character simulations
- 🎲 Dice rolling and probability games
- 🎨 Retro 90s web design aesthetic
- 📱 Simple, lightweight experiences that run in any browser
- ⚡ No external dependencies - pure vanilla JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click on any of the "Snake" links to explore different experiences:
   - **Snake 1**: Use arrow keys to control your snake, eat red apples, avoid walls and yourself
   - **Snake 2**: Type messages to interact with the gangster chat simulation
   - **Snake 3**: Click buttons to get Snake Jailbird quotes or trigger his escape sequence
   - **Snake 4**: Type any phrase to generate a Samuel L. Jackson style response
   - **Snake 5**: Read the snake_case mystery story
   - **Snake 6**: Click "Roll Dice" to keep rolling until you hit snake eyes

## Development

This was a quick coding exercise born out of boredom on a flight. Each "Snake" themed experience is self-contained in its own HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support basic JavaScript ES5. Only Snake 1 requires HTML5 Canvas support.
